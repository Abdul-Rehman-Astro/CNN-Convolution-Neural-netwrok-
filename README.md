A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network that has one or more convolutional layers and are used mainly for image processing, classification, segmentation and also for other auto correlated data.CNNs have been used for understanding in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech recognition, although often for NLP Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) are used.
